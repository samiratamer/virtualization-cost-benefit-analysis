Executive Summary
As part of its server virtualization strategy, HostPenny plans to replace its 35,000
physical servers with 3,500 new, more powerful servers that run virtual machines. Even if
acquiring new servers and software has a high initial cost, the overall expenditures over the next
five years will be significantly lower than if the current system keeps running.

HostPenny's servers presently cost more than $3.3 billion to operate and maintain over a
five-year period, mostly due to staffing and backup operations. It is estimated that the new
virtualized system will save the firm $1.35 billion over the same time period, at a cost of around
$1.95 billion. These savings are mostly a result of less backup time and organizational effort, as
virtual servers are easier to manage and need less maintenance.

In conclusion, despite the huge initial investment, the virtualization project will
significantly cut recurrent costs and increase productivity. It is a wise and cost-effective move for
HostPenny in the long run.
