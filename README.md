# Virtualization Cost-Benefit Analysis – HostPenny

A 5-year financial analysis comparing the cost of maintaining a current physical server infrastructure versus migrating to a virtualized system for a simulated enterprise client, HostPenny.

## Project Summary
HostPenny currently operates 35,000 physical servers at a projected 5-year cost of over $3.3 billion. This analysis evaluates replacing that infrastructure with 3,500 new virtualized servers and calculates the projected savings over the same period.

## Key Findings
- Current 5-year infrastructure cost: $3,303,729,457.98
- Proposed virtualized system cost: $1,950,248,113.87
- Net 5-year savings: $1,353,481,344.11
- Savings are driven primarily by reduced server administration time and backup operations

## What the Spreadsheet Covers
- Constants and shared variables (power rates, administrative costs, storage costs)
- Current scenario: hard and soft costs across 5 server groups over 5 years
- Proposed scenario: new server purchases, virtualization software, training, and reduced operational costs
- Final cost summary comparing both scenarios year by year

## Concepts Used
- Enterprise IT cost modeling
- Server virtualization planning
- Hard cost vs. soft cost analysis
- 5-year TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) calculation
- Executive summary writing for IT decision-makers
